# Goals

- Implement an advanced rasterizer that can handle complex scenes.
- Support for various shading techniques.
- Integration with modern OpenGL features.
- Performance optimizations for real-time rendering.
- Extensive documentation and examples for users.
- Support for various input formats and scene descriptions.
